# Summary 
Create a client side application that will allow users to initiate an online transaction and check on the status of the transaction. The transaction itself will take place by means of an API provided by Client. 80|20 will be a 100% client-side HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application that will be deployed by others as a GitHub Pages static website.

#To be provided by Client 
* Marketing copy
* Style guide (if applicable)
* Images / logo
* Terms and Conditions (T&C) the user must accept
* Validation rules for:
  * AMP Address
  * Ethereum Address
  * Receipt

# Testing
The application will be tested using a 80|20 private GitHub repo. Even though the code will be private during testing, the pages will be publicly exposed. After testing the test GitHub pages will be removed. 

# Deployment
The website resources will be packaged as a zip and delivered to Client. 

80|20 will provide software development, testing, and project management of the above scope of work.
